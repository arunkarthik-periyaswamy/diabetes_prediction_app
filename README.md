# Diabetes Prediction App
A machine learning-powered web application to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on user-input health parameters. This project demonstrates the practical application of data science and machine learning in healthcare, providing an accessible interface for early diabetes risk assessment.

# Project Overview
This repository contains a complete workflow for building, training, and deploying a diabetes prediction model. The app uses a pre-trained machine learning model to analyze health data and predict whether an individual is at risk of diabetes. The project is designed for educational and demonstration purposes, showing how data science can be used to address real-world health challenges.

# Features
